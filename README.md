## Project Overview
This project is an attempt to recreate LinkedIn with limited UI functionalities using React.JS, firebase, Redux. 

## How to proceed with the project : 
1. Clone into a folder. 
2. Open terminal, type "npm install".
3. Create a .env file containing the name API_KEY="" <= your API key inside the quote (keep it without quotes).
4. To start project, type "npm start".
5. Open localhost:3000 on any browser

## Future Plans
I plan to add the feature of liking and also how to share each post with a unique link. I will also add a separate button for signing out as well. Stay tuned.
